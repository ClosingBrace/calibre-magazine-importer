# Calibre Magazine Importer

a script to import digital magazines into Calibre

## Description

_Calibre Magazine Importer_ is a script to import digital magazines into a Calibre library.

It uses the fact that the magazines use filenames that have a fixed and a variable part. The fixed
part can be used to identify the series, authors and publisher. The variable part follows a pattern
from which information can be extracted to calculate the issue's volume, index and release date.
